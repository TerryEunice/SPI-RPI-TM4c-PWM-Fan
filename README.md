# SPI-RPI-TM4c-PWM-Fan
Uses SPI to communicate from a Raspberry Pi 3B to a TI TM4c Launchpad to control a 4 pin PWM Computer Fan.

Uses the bcm2835 library (http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html) for Raspberry Pi GPIO. You must have this installed on your device to run the Raspberry Pi software.

Uses 'ValvanoWare' by Jonathan W. Valvano (valvano@mail.utexas.edu) for TM4C PWM & PLL drivers and other TM4C starter code. This code is included with the TM4c code.
